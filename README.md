### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua Blevins, I am a self-taught web developer. I have been working as a professional React developer since 2017. I have been on two design system teams one as a developer and one as a technical lead, worked in many different Enterprises, and code in my free time. My current goal is to build a component library that is WCAG AAA compliant out of the box, comes with no styles, and doesn't hide content from search engine spiders.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently working on web a11y and design systems.
- I'm currently learning Vue.
- I'm looking to collaborate on building tools to make design systems easier.
- I'm looking for help with color theory.
- Ask me about a11y.
- How to reach me: email.
- Fun fact: I like to play guitar.

My name is Joshua Blevins, I am a self-taught web developer. I have been working as a professional React developer since 2017. I have been on two design system teams one as a developer and one as a technical lead. My current goal is to build a component library that is WCAG AAA compliant out of the box, comes with no styles, and doesn't hide content from search engine spiders.
